<h1>Mohiniyattam</h1>

   <br> <p>Manipravalam (Malayalam: മണിപ്രവാളം, Tamil: மணிப்பிரவாளம், romanized: Maņipravāļam) is a macaronic language found in some manuscripts of South India. It is a hybrid language, typically written in the Grantha script, which combines Sanskrit lexicon and Dravidian morpho-syntax.[1][2][3] According to language scholars Giovanni Ciotti and Marco Franceschini, the blending of Tamil and Sanskrit is evidenced in manuscripts and their colophons over a long period of time, and this ultimately may have contributed to the emergence of Manipravalam.[4] However, the 14th century Sanskrit work Lilatilakam states that Manipravalam is a combination of Dravidian and Sanskrit.[5] Generally, it is agreed that it was a combination of Middle Tamil and Sanskrit.[6][5][7][8]

        The twelfth century has been described as a watershed moment in the history of Malayalam, where it was finally accepted as a vehicle for literary expression. The two dominant schools in Malayalam writing were the pattu and the manipravalam, the former being influenced by Tamil poetic traditions and the latter designated for Sanskrit influences. Despite their extraneous regulation, the two schools would come to dominate the edifice of Malayalam poetry that they continue to shape its style to this day.[9]</p>
