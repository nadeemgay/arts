<h1>Pinjar</h1>

    <p>
        "Pinjar" is set in the time of the 1947 partition.

        Puro is a young woman of Hindu background, who lives a happy, comfortable life with her family. She is engaged to a kind young man, Ramchand, who is from an upstanding family. While on an outing with her younger sister Rajjo, Puro is suddenly kidnapped by a mysterious man, Rashid. Rashid's family has an ancestral dispute with Puro's family. In the past, Puro's family had made Rashid's family homeless by taking over their property. Puro's uncle had even kidnapped Rashid's aunt and then released her after raping her. The task of exacting revenge is given to Rashid, and his family tells him to kidnap Puro, to settle the score.
        
        Rashid goes through with the kidnapping but cannot bring himself to be cruel to Puro, since he is drawn to her. One night, Puro manages to escape and return to her parents. Her parents woefully turn away their daughter, explaining that if Puro were to stay, Rashid's extended clan would slaughter everyone in their family. Left with no support, Puro returns to Rashid who is well-aware of Puro's escape; he knew she wouldn't be let in by her parents and had been waiting for her nearby.
        
        After a few months, Puro's family marries their son Trilok to Ramchand's younger sister, Lajjo, while Rajjo is married to Ramchand's cousin. Meanwhile, Rashid marries Puro, and they settle into an uneasy routine of husband and wife, during which time Puro becomes pregnant but miscarries.
